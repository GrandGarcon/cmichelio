I post a progress report showing what I did and how my products performed each month.
Last month's report can be seen [here](/progress-report-june-2018).

## What did I do

![Productive Hours in July](./rescueTime.png)

I worked 46 _productive_ hours last month although I was on vacation the last week(s) as you can see. üí™ (Tracked using [RescueTime](/redirects/rescuetime).)  
I watched [Barry - S1](https://trakt.tv/shows/barry/seasons/1), [The 7 Deadly Sins - S2](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-seven-deadly-sins/seasons/2).

I launched King of EOS, my first blockchain EOS app! More on that later.

## Mobile Apps
### Downloads
Total downloads of all my apps went down to **666** üòà this month. Slightly down again.

### In-App Purchases
In-app Purchases **went down to a single (!) order**. (-4)

I made an estimated **3.41‚Ç¨** (-13.65‚Ç¨) this way.

### Ad Revenue
My ad revenue went up to **56.65‚Ç¨** (+6.58‚Ç¨) for 52,700 AdMob banner impressions.

## Blockchain Dapps
### King of EOS

I [launched King of EOS](/introducing-king-of-eos/) as my first blockchain dapp at the end of July and overall it was a big success.
I shared it on some platforms (reddit, telegram, eos project directories, etc.) and itself was shared again by the people using it.

The _king_ of the first ever kingdom _"Kingdom of the un-named"_ on the EOS blockchain is **saidno2banks**.
He's now in the [Hall of Fame](https://kingofeos.com/) as the first eternal ruler by bidding the final price of 4460 EOS.
Congrats. ‚ú®
Overall there were 28 bids on the throne, quickly goading each other at the beginning.

If we look at the traffic, we see it's also a nice way to promote your projects receiving 650 views per day on average:

## Platform Growth
### Website
Sessions went up to 9310 on my website.

Due to being on vacation, I did again **not** stick to my bi-weekly post schedule.
I only wrote one article about King of EOS but will release another one about its development in the next days.

1. [Introducing King of EOS ü•Å](/introducing-king-of-eos/)

### Subscribers
My [twitter](https://twitter.com/cmichelio) followers increased by _21_ to 292.

## What's next
Full focus on the book and a potential new blockchain project.

I should also track the signups for [Learn EOS](https://learneos.dev) in these monthly reports.
I need to automate all of this, it's becoming too much to do manually üò¨ 

* Write tutorials for free and link to my book. Collect email addresses. All while actually writing the book.
