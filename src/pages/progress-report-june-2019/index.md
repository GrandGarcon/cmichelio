## What did I do

_Hours worked on **side-projects** in June_

I only worked **55** _productive_ hours last month.
Moving out of my apartment and everything that comes with it took a lot of time.

I did **not** stick to my bi-weekly schedule of releasing a blog post.
Again, I managed to only write one.

My [twitter](https://twitter.com/cmichelio) followers increased by _9_ to **480**.

### Learn EOS Development Subscribers

I currently have **478** email subscribers for [my book](https://learneos.dev).

I sold 8 books in June.

## What's next

Keep working on my projects and publish more posts again.
