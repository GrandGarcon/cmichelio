I post a progress report showing what I did and how my products performed each month.
Last month's report can be seen [here](/<%= previousReportSlug %>).

## What did I do

![Productive Hours in <%= currentMonth %>](./clockify.png)
_Hours worked on **side-projects** in <%= currentMonth %>_

I worked **68** _productive_ on side projects hours last month.

To make these progress reports a bit more interesting, from now on I'll post my favourite song, TV show, and article I read last month.

* **Article of the Month**: [Schelling fences on slippery slopes](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Kbm6QnJv9dgWsPHQP/schelling-fences-on-slippery-slopes)
* **Song of the Month**: [Dennis da Menace & Brous One - Gourmet](https://open.spotify.com/track/5hBCrlxAhj6LVKDR2PGZcs?si=G8GZ2v9xSRmTc9goIDfrXw)
