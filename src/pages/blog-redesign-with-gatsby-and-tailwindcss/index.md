- time to redesign blog again
- fourth redesign. name them
- this time: new design
- before and after

## tech

- removed glamorous
- used my metaballs-js package that I wrote in webgl for the background effect
- big fan of tailwind css as so much faster than most other frameworks I've used. like writing inline styles but less frowned upon
- correctly use gatsby, i.e., gatsby-image with graphql to automatically resize images to the needed sizes. no need for manual preprocessing or providers like cloudinary

## performance

- show web.dev
- show JS + css size
