I did **not** stick to my bi-weekly schedule of releasing a blog post.
As always, I managed to only write one... this is becoming a thing now.

1. [How to fetch any secondary EOSIO table index using eosjs](/how-to-fetch-table-indexes-using-eosjs/)

### Subscribers

My [twitter](https://twitter.com/cmichelio) followers increased by _4_ to **484**.

### Learn EOS Development Subscribers

I currently have **483** email subscribers for [my book](https://learneos.dev).
I again sold 8 books in July.

## What's next

I've been occupied with real-life a lot recently - that's why my social media presence and this blog didn't get much attention.
I noticed that I use Twitter less and less myself, it feels like there are the same posts over and over, and I don't get anything useful out of it.
It has mostly turned into a time sink and I don't see that changing soon.
My focus will primarily be my work & side projects that I'm working on, and secondly this blog - disregarding anything else.
