Following the tradition of [2018](/goals-2018) and [2019](/goals-2019), I'll revisit my previous year's goals and see what I achieved, and set new goals for 2020.

## Goals from 2019

> ‚úÖ Finish the book in the first quarter of the year

I did this. I launched the [Learn EOS Development](https://learneos.dev) book on March 23rd.

> üèÅ Earn 1000 EUR / month by end of the year through my side-projects

The only side-project I launched was my book. I made a bit over 100 sales with my book and some sponsorships, so let's say about 6000$ last year - or 500$ per month on average. However, the book sales slowed down after the launch of course, so I'm not able to keep up the average - it's more like 150$-200$ for book sales.

So I definitely **failed** this goal.

I assumed I'd work on more income-generating side projects after my book launch, but I did not.
The reason for that is that I usually work on side projects after my main job(s) are done, but I did not in the second half of the year.
Instead, I spend my free time working as part of a team of open-source developers on Vigor, the stablecoin project on EOS run as a DAO/DAC.

Still, I'm happy with my decision, I always wanted to work on an open-source project and gain experience running a DAC.
I get paid in VIG tokens though which has the same feeling of working for 100% equity in a startup. They are worth nothing but have future potential. üòÅ


> ‚ò†Ô∏è Grow my blog viewers to 20,000 / month. (It flattened out at 10,000 sessions per month for quite a while.) Set up a tiny newsletter.

This did not happen. I am still stagnating at the same 10,000 session / month.
No idea, if Google changed the algorithm or I am writing too much for a niche at the moment because the twitter engagement and feedback I personally receive on my posts is better than in 2018.

The [tinynewsletter](https://tinyletter.com/) idea is great, I totally forgot about it.

> ‚ò†Ô∏è Keep up the bi-weekly blog-post consistency

This is a goal I have full control over but still failed.
That's why it hurts the most.

I only managed to write 12/26 blog posts last year. It's not that I don't have anything to write about - quite the opposite is the case.
It just comes down to priorities again, and writing blog posts is always one of the lowest on my list of career ToDos.
But I get a lot of leads through my blog and introductions to great people that read my blog, maybe it should actually be a higher priority.

## Goals for 2020

It's really interesting to me that I failed almost all of my goals, but I still feel that 2019 was a great year career-wise and **not pursuing these goals** was the correct decision.
Maybe it's because I only write about career goals, and never set goals about my job, an income I want to earn, my finances, etc.
I 'm still in the mindset that this blog is about creating side projects and new income streams first and foremost - the indie maker concept.
And, in the end, side-projects have a low-priority by (my) definition.

So I'm not even sure if it makes sense to set low-priority goals.
At some points, they just turn into a list of things I 'd like to pursue next year, but might also not care about that much either ...

I'm also rediscovering old truths, like _passive income is not really passive_, especially if you're a developer or an author.
It's not enough to put in a lot of work in the beginning, if you want to maintain the _passive_ income you need to maintain the product.

Enough with the existential crisis, here are my "_goals_" for 2020:

* Get back to a bi-weekly blog-post consistency.
* Set up tinyletter for my blog and fully automate the sending of email notifications every month with my latest blog posts. (I already know I am not going to do it if I have to write a personalized email for every post. üòÉ)
* Launch a new side-project with the potential to earn income
* Be open to throw away these goals if they become irrelevant, my priorities change, or other better opportunities come along.
