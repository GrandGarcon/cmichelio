I post a progress report showing what I did and how my products performed each month.
Last month's report can be seen [here](/<%= previousReportSlug %>).

## What did I do

![Productive Hours in <%= currentMonth %>](./rescueTime.png)

I worked **80** _productive_ hours last month. I think this is a new record for this year. ðŸ’ª
I finished [Preacher - S3](https://trakt.tv/shows/preacher/seasons/3), started [Better Call Saul - S4](https://trakt.tv/shows/better-call-saul/seasons/4).

I finished the first chapter of my book [Learn EOS Development](https://learneos.one), created a nice PDF preview out of it, automatically sent it out on new signups, and split it up into smaller tutorials that I'll release here on my blog.
I also added open graph meta tags to all blog posts.

Some nice words I received last month:

> Hi Christoph, I just implemented your "How to access Google Spreadsheets with Node".  I'm a hobbyist programmer.  Cleanest way to do it by far, and I was looking everywhere!

> The world is waiting for this book man, I assure you!

A Chinese company wants the exclusive rights for my book and translate it into Chinese.

I was called a [React Native expert](https://ideamotive.co/blog/best-react-native-experts-blogs/), right next to Dan Abramov.

## Mobile Apps

### Downloads

Total downloads of all my apps went up to **?** this month. An increase in every app. Is it finally summer time again and people are downloading more fitness apps?

### In-App Purchases

In-app Purchases went back up to 5 thanks to PPL workout. (+4)

I made an estimated **?â‚¬** (+?â‚¬) this way.

### Ad Revenue

My ad revenue went down to **?â‚¬** (-?â‚¬) for 52,700 AdMob banner impressions.

## Platform Growth

### Website

Sessions went up to **10,891** on my website.

![Website Traffic](./website-traffic.png)

I stuck to my bi-weekly schedule of releasing a blog post. It's easy when you have written a whole book chapter. I already have other posts in the pipeline.

1. [Learnings from building my first dapp on EOS blockchain](/releasing-my-first-eos-dapp/)
1. [C++ Guide for EOS Development - Basics](/cpp-guide-for-eos-development-basics/)
1. [C++ Guide for EOS Development - Call by value / reference](/cpp-guide-for-eos-development-call-by-value-reference/)

### Subscribers

My [twitter](https://twitter.com/cmichelio) followers increased by _26_ to **318**. People like the EOS content.

### Learn EOS Development Subscribers

I currently have **109** email subscribers for [my book](https://learneos.one).
I would have never expected such a big amount through organic growth.

## What's next

Full focus on the next chapters of the book.

* Write tutorials for free and link to my book. Collect email addresses. All while actually writing the book.
* Add a way to automate these progress reports? I played around with `yeoman` generators last months, a really nice way to scaffold projects / blog posts.
