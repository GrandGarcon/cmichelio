        If you want something built from scratch or need more manpower in your
        team for an existing project, please get in contact with me. I worked on
        many projects in the{` `}

        (frontend and backend) and{` `}

        technologies I enjoyed working with in the past:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>ES6/7, TypeScript, Lerna, Webpack</li>
        <li>
          React, GraphQL - Apollo Client, Redux, Jest, PostCSS / SCSS, Styled
          Components, TailwindCSS
        </li>
        <li>
          Node.js, Express, Koa, GraphQL - Apollo Server, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
        </li>
        <li>Smart Contracts (EOSIO, C++), IPFS</li>
        <li>Smart Contract Security Audits</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Having said that, I learn extremely fast and I'm confident I can pick up
        and be productive with any technology within a couple of days.
