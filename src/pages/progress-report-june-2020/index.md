I post a progress report showing what I did and how my products performed each month.
Last month's report can be seen [here](/progress-report-may-2020).

## What did I do

![Productive Hours in June](./clockify.png)
_Hours worked on **side-projects** in June_

I worked **59** _productive_ on side projects hours last month.

To make these progress reports a bit more interesting, from now on I'll post my favourite song, TV show, and article I read last month.

* **Article of the Month**: [NFT Liquidity Pools](https://hive.blog/wax/@wax.world/moooooooooooo)
* **Song of the Month**: Continuing last month: [More Meaning Wave](https://www.youtube.com/user/akirathedon/videos)
* **TV series of the Month**: [Rick & Morty S04](https://trakt.tv/shows/rick-and-morty/seasons/4)

### What was worked on

- Same old. It was a very busy month but no side projects to announce.

## Platform Growth

### Website

Sessions stayed at **6,314** on my website.

I did **not** stick to my bi-weekly schedule of releasing a blog post.
I was too busy with work. I didn't manage to write any blog post because I was working on the weekends which is my usual time to write blog posts.
July should be better, and I have lots of blog post ideas.

### Subscribers

My [twitter](https://twitter.com/cmichelio) followers increased by _9_ to **610**.

## Sales

#### Learn EOS Development

I sold 5 books last month.

#### Trading

I made 200 EOS last month trading crypto.

## What's next

These progress reports are getting boring because I spent all of my time on client work.
I hope I can find some time to slowly get a new side project going on the weekends again.
The first things will be updating my arbitrage bot - the competition got strong.
As always I have lots of cool ideas but not never enough time ðŸ˜ƒ
