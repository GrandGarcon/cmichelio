I post a progress report showing what I did and how my products performed each month.
Last month's report can be seen [here](/progress-report-may-2018).

## What did I do

![Productive Hours in June](./rescueTime.png)

I worked 48 _productive_ hours. üí™ (Tracked using [RescueTime](/redirects/rescuetime).)  
I didn't watch anything new in June.

As you can see from the number's I didn't do much. At least, I finished the [landing page](https://learneos.one) for my new book about EOS smart contract development.
Now I'm ready to start producing the first content üòç

## Apps
### Downloads
Total downloads of all my apps went up to **715** this month. I finally gained about 80 downloads again after a rough downward trend the last couple of months.

### In-App Purchases
In-app Purchases **went down to 5 orders**. (-4)

I made an estimated **17.06‚Ç¨** (-16.68‚Ç¨) this way.

### Ad Revenue
My ad revenue stayed at **50.07‚Ç¨** (+1.79‚Ç¨) for 52,000 AdMob banner impressions.

I did **not** stick to my bi-weekly post schedule.
I only wrote one article and did not finish another post this weekend.
But, I'm sure I can make up for that in July.

1. [Building a landing page in Vue.js](/building-a-landing-page-in-vuejs/)

### Subscribers
My [twitter](https://twitter.com/cmichelio) followers increased by _10_ to 271.

## What's next
Finish up what's left over from last month:

* I still have to fix my EOS proof of concept app for version 1 and deploy it.
* Write tutorials for free and link to my book. Collect email addresses. All while actually writing the book.
* I should live-stream my coding more again.
