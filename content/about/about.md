## Welcome to cmichel.io.
I 'm **Christoph Michel**. I hold a bachelor's degree in both Math and Computer Science and will finish my master studies in Computer Science this year.
I decided to not go for a PhD and rather work on my own projects trying to earn an income online.

The interesting part is that there is no blueprint for that and most advice takes the form of _"These are the lottery numbers
that worked for me"_.
I 'll learn and figure out things as they come without sugarcoating anything to upsell you a course -
not because I'm such an honest and nice person, it's just that I haven't created a course yet ðŸ˜‰.
I use this site as a blog to document my _full_ journey while posting tutorials on the newest technologies, because learning fast and coding is what I'm good at.
