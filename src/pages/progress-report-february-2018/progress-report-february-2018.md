I post a progress report showing what I did and how my products performed each month.
Last month's report can be seen [here](/progress-report-january-2018).

## What did I do

![Productive Hours in February](./rescueTime.png)

I worked 37 _productive_ hours. (Tracked using [RescueTime](/redirects/rescuetime).)  
I _started_ watching several new TV shows like Kevin Probably Saves The World, Devilman Crybaby, Blood Drive, but I wasn't really hooked and I didn't continue watching.  

I didn't finish any new books.  

There was a lot going on and I couldn't focus as much on my side projects as I wanted to. Still, I was able to finish my [Steem Remind.Bot Project](/steem-remind-bot/). Go ahead and use it! March should be a more distraction-free month again.

## Apps
### Downloads
Total downloads of all my apps increased drastically to **990** this month. Back down roughly 200 downloads again from the January record month.

### In-App Purchases
In-app Purchases are currently at only 4 orders. (+1)

I made an estimated **13.65â‚¬** (+3.41â‚¬) this way.

### Ad Revenue
My ad revenue stayed at **56.65â‚¬** (-2.02â‚¬) for 76,246 (!) Google AdMob banner impressions.

1. [Differences in Defining ES6 Class Methods](/es6-class-methods-differences/)
1. [Creating a Remind-Me bot for Steem](/steem-remind-bot/)


### Subscribers
My [twitter](https://twitter.com/cmichelio) followers increased by _18_ to 234.

## What's next
I 'll be developing and releasing my first DAPP for [EOS](https://eos.io). ðŸ‘Œ Stay tuned. I'll live-stream some parts again.
